    "answer": "My name is Nayan Reddy Soma, and I’m a data enthusiast with a strong foundation in analytics, data visualization, and automation. I recently completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve applied these skills through hands-on projects. One of the most impactful was building an interactive Expense Tracking System using Python (FastAPI), MySQL, and Streamlit. I implemented a session-based architecture so each user gets a private, real-time analytical view of their expenses.\n\nI also developed a full-scale Power BI project called Business 360, where I worked with 1.8M+ rows of data from both offline and online retail channels. I designed a snowflake schema, created advanced DAX measures, and built six dashboard pages tailored to Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive stakeholders.\n\nAcross my projects, I’ve worked with over 3.5 million rows of data and covered domains like finance, operations, and consumer behavior. I’m confident with tools like Power BI, SQL, Python (especially Pandas), and Excel, and I’m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful business insights. I’m now looking to join a team where I can keep growing as a data analyst and contribute to solving real-world challenges.

  ],
  "answer": "I prefer working in a team. Collaboration brings fresh perspectives, helps catch blind spots, and makes problem-solving more dynamic. For example, during my Power BI and full-stack projects, I often imagined different stakeholder viewpoints — like how finance vs. supply chain would use the data — which is a mindset that comes naturally when you work with diverse people.\n\nThat said, I’m also comfortable working independently when needed. I enjoy deep work and problem-solving on my own, especially during development phases. But overall, I find team environments more energizing and growth-oriented."

  "answer": "I treat failure as feedback. Whenever something doesn’t go as planned — whether it’s a technical issue or a missed expectation — I try to reflect on why it happened and what I can learn from it.\n\nFor example, while working on my full-stack Expense Tracker project, I initially misjudged how session handling would work in real-time. Instead of getting stuck, I broke the problem down, read the docs carefully, tested multiple approaches, and eventually made the app more robust.\n\nI’ve learned that failure is often just part of the process — not a sign to quit, but a chance to grow smarter."

  "answer": "After completing my graduation, I was placed in a full-stack development role at ExcelR through campus placements. However, over the course of my B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML), I realized that my interests lie less in deep coding and more in business problem-solving, stakeholder communication, and decision-making.\n\nWith that clarity, I chose to pursue an MBA and a career in management consulting or business analytics, which aligned more closely with my strengths. I decided to decline the offer from ExcelR and focus on preparing for the CAT exam, where I secured a 96.42 percentile. Unfortunately, as a general category applicant, that score wasn’t sufficient for the top IIMs.\n\nDuring this period, I continued exploring roles that blended business understanding with technical skills, which naturally led me to data analytics. It offered the perfect balance — allowing me to apply logic and data to real-world business scenarios. I spent the year upskilling, working on hands-on projects, and building a portfolio that reflects my transition and capabilities."

I immersed myself in the field by:\n• Completing structured online courses in Power BI, SQL, Python, and Advanced Excel\n• Building end-to-end projects, including an Expense Management app (Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, MySQL) and a Business 360 Power BI dashboard analyzing over 1.8 million rows\n• Developing an Excel-based performance dashboard to enhance automation and reporting skills\n\nThis year wasn’t just a gap — it was a career transformation phase. I now feel more aligned with my strengths, confident in my technical skills, and ready to contribute meaningfully in a data-driven role."

  "answer": "My degree in CSE with a specialization in AI & ML gave me a solid foundation in logic, algorithms, and model design. However, as I progressed through the course and worked on practical problems, I realized that my true interest lies in bridging the gap between data and business decisions, not just developing machine learning models.\n\nI found myself more drawn to roles that required understanding business needs, analyzing patterns in data, and translating insights into actions. This naturally aligned with the data analytics domain, where I could apply both my technical background and business mindset.\n\nFor example, in my Power BI project, I enjoyed shaping the entire data pipeline, designing meaningful KPIs, and communicating insights across functions like finance, marketing, and supply chain. Similarly, in my Expense Tracker project, I focused on user-centric design, session-level analytics, and real-time tracking — all of which required understanding both tech and business logic.\n\nSo while AI/ML gave me a strong analytical base, data analytics is where I truly feel aligned — it’s where technology meets business, and that’s where I want to be."

My Power BI Business 360 dashboard handles over 1.8 million rows across domains like sales, supply chain, and marketing, designed to offer CXO-level insights.\n\nI’ve also cultivated soft skills — like communication, ownership, and structured thinking — by learning independently and staying accountable to goals without external pressure.

However, I’ve worked extensively on practical, real-world data analytics projects to develop and showcase my expertise.\n\nHere are some highlights of my experience through projects:\n\n1. My main project is this AI Assistant you're interacting with now. I engineered it as a full-stack application with a strong **data analytics** component at its core. A key feature is the **live analytics dashboard** I built, which tracks and visualizes user engagement and my own performance in real-time.\n\nThis project showcases my ability to handle a complete project lifecycle—from designing a complex AI system to deploying it and, most importantly, analyzing its performance through data. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Nayan-Reddy/Nayan-chatbot)\n\n2. Power BI Expertise: Built a Business 360 Dashboard analyzing 1.8 million rows of sales and marketing data. It involved advanced DAX measures, ETL processes, and creating industry-standard visuals for stakeholders.

SQL: The Consumer Goods project was an in-depth SQL challenge where I acted as a data analyst for an FMCG company. The goal was to solve 10 critical, real-world business problems by translating ad-hoc requests from management into actionable data insights.\nUsing MySQL, I wrote a series of complex queries to address questions related to:\n\n* **Market & Sales Performance:** Identifying top-performing products and analyzing weekly sales growth.\n* **Customer Insights:** Calculating Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and performing cohort analysis to understand retention.\n* **Supply Chain:** Evaluating supplier on-time performance and managing inventory levels. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Nayan-Reddy/Consumer-goods)\n\n5. Advanced Excel: Designed division-level and category-level sales dashboards with slicers, trend analysis, and KPIs for business insights and reporting.\n[Explore Excel Project](https://1drv.ms/x/c/e4ca29151a0a4ec4/EeJ0-_SJhOZIjam0emzh_ccBfDKFeWhL2IMsVI7DXtXB0Q?e=jisfwq)\n\nWhile I’m still building my professional track record, my hands-on experience with large datasets, dashboards, and actionable insights has equipped me to hit the ground running in data-driven roles.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more specifics about any of my projects or skills! 🙂"

That foundation has only made me stronger as a data analyst.\n\nWhat I realized over time was that I enjoy the parts of data work where analysis, interpretation, and business impact take center stage. Data analytics allows me to connect with stakeholders, tell stories with data, and see the immediate effect of my work — and that’s where I thrive.\n\nI don’t see it as abandoning AI/ML — I see it as choosing the space where I can bring the most value right now."

My work reflects not just skill, but intention, clarity, and ownership.\n\nI don’t just want a job — I’m ready to make a meaningful contribution from day one."

  ],
  "answer": "I believe the key to effective communication is empathy and simplification. Whenever I work with non-technical stakeholders, I first focus on understanding their goals, not the tools. Once I know what decisions they need to make, I tailor my explanations to match their perspective — avoiding jargon like “DAX” or “joins” and instead focusing on outcomes like “sales increased 15% in the south region” or “this category had unusually high returns.”\n\nFor example, in my Power BI dashboard (Business 360), I created separate views for executives, finance, marketing, and supply chain — each with tailored KPIs and plain-language tooltips, so anyone could understand the insights at a glance without needing to know how the backend worked.\n\nIn short, I always aim to translate data into decisions, not just reports."

  "answer": "During my major academic project, I worked on detecting anomalies in kidney structures—like cysts, stones, and tumors—using deep learning models. The problem was identifying such conditions from medical scan images with high accuracy. I collected and preprocessed a dataset of kidney ultrasound images, then used convolutional neural networks to train a model that could classify anomalies. After tuning the model and validating its performance, we achieved strong accuracy metrics. This project showed me how powerful data can be in solving real-world, high-impact problems—especially in healthcare, where accuracy and efficiency are critical."

For visual insights, I integrated **Matplotlib** and **Streamlit charts** to provide:\n\n- **Time-series trends** showing monthly spending vs income\n- **Top 5 expense categories** per month or overall\n- **Category-wise analysis** like Food, Travel, Utilities, etc.\n- **Spending heatmaps** and bar charts to identify high-cost areas\n- **Dynamic dashboards** that respond in real-time to user input\n\nEach user session is isolated using a **unique session ID**, allowing the app to provide **personalized insights** while also enabling a switch to demo mode when needed. This helped demonstrate session-based analytics — crucial in real-world multi-user environments.\n\nThe project simulates real user behavior by tracking detailed entries and turning them into actionable insights. This mirrors how analysts operate in companies — identifying overspending, setting budgets, spotting trends, and helping stakeholders take data-backed decisions.\n\nOverall, this project showcases my ability to work across the **data analysis pipeline**: from data collection and transformation to **interactive visual storytelling** and real-time analytics — using tools like **Pandas, SQL, Matplotlib, and Streamlit**.\n\n You can view try out the live app here \n[Try the App](https://expense-tracker-frontend-nayan-reddy.streamlit.app/) [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Nayan-Reddy/expense-tracker-frontend)\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper — like **what kind of analysis my app offered**, **how I handled session isolation**, or **how analytics were implemented** — feel free to ask!"

I'm a full-stack AI assistant built to serve as an interactive portfolio.\n\nThe core of my system is an advanced **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. When you ask a question, I first use semantic search to find the most accurate answer from a knowledge base. If that's not a perfect match, I use fuzzy matching as a backup. Only if neither can answer do I fall back on a generative model (GPT-4o).\n\nTo ensure our conversations stay on topic, I have **'Intelligent Guardrails'** built with **spaCy** for Named Entity Recognition. This helps me recognize and filter out-of-scope or sensitive questions.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, my frontend is built with **Streamlit**, and the entire backend logic is in Python. One of my key features is a **real-time analytics pipeline** that logs user interactions to a Google Sheet, which then feeds a live dashboard to visualize my performance and user engagement. You can explore the complete source code on GitHub. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Nayan-Reddy/Nayan-chatbot) [Analytics Dashboard](https://nayan-chatbot-analytics.streamlit.app/)"

  "answer": "My days are a structured blend of focused learning, hands-on application, and staying active.\n\nI dedicate my mornings to learning, whether it's diving into new machine learning concepts, mastering a Python library, or studying for a certification. I find this is when I'm most effective at absorbing new information.\n\nAfternoons are all about putting that knowledge into practice. This is my prime time for coding, working on personal projects like this AI assistant, or solving complex data problems.\n\nIn the evenings, I make sure to step away from the screen. I enjoy going for a run or playing badminton, which helps me clear my head and stay energized. Later, I'll often catch up on tech blogs or industry news to stay current. This routine helps me maintain a healthy balance between deep work and physical activity."
